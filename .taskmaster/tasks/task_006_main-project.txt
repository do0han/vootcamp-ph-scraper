# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Main Scraper Orchestrator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main script to coordinate all scraping activities and manage the overall flow.
# Details:
1. Create 'main.py' file
2. Implement the main scraping workflow:
   a. Initialize all scrapers and Supabase connection
   b. Set up logging
   c. Implement error handling and retry logic
   d. Coordinate the execution of each scraper module
   e. Manage data flow from scrapers to Supabase
3. Implement command-line arguments for flexible execution (e.g., specific platform scraping)
