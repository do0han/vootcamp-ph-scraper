# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Data Versioning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a system to version and track changes in scraped data over time.
# Details:
1. Modify Supabase schema to include versioning fields (e.g., version_number, valid_from, valid_to)
2. Update 'supabase_manager.py' to handle data versioning:
   a. Implement logic to create new versions of data
   b. Develop functions to retrieve specific versions of data
   c. Implement archiving mechanism for old versions
3. Modify data insertion logic to check for changes before creating new versions
4. Implement a cleanup routine to manage old versions based on configurable retention policy

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for versioning logic. Verify that new versions are created correctly when data changes. Test retrieval of specific versions and archiving functionality.
