# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Parallel Scraping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize scraping performance by implementing parallel execution of scraping tasks.
# Details:
1. Research parallel processing libraries (e.g., concurrent.futures)
2. Modify scraper modules to support parallel execution
3. Implement a task queue system for managing parallel scraping jobs
4. Ensure proper handling of shared resources (e.g., proxy pool, rate limits)
5. Implement load balancing to distribute scraping tasks efficiently
6. Add configurable parameters for controlling parallelism level
7. Update main orchestrator to leverage parallel scraping capabilities

# Test Strategy:
Develop tests to verify parallel execution. Measure performance improvements. Test with various parallelism levels. Ensure that resource sharing and rate limiting are working correctly in parallel scenarios.
