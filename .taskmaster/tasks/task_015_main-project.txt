# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Caching Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a caching system to store frequently accessed data and reduce API calls.
# Details:
1. Research and select a caching library (e.g., cachetools 5.3.1)
2. Create a new file 'cache_manager.py'
3. Implement functions to:
   a. Cache API responses and scraped data
   b. Set appropriate expiration times for different data types
   c. Retrieve data from cache when available
4. Integrate caching mechanism with all scraper modules
5. Implement cache invalidation strategy for outdated data
6. Use memory caching for short-lived data and file-based caching for longer-term storage

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for caching logic. Verify that data is correctly cached and retrieved. Test cache expiration and invalidation. Measure performance improvements with caching enabled.
