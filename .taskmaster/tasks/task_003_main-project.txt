# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Shopee Data Scraper
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a module to scrape product data from Shopee Philippines using Selenium.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'shopee_scraper.py'
2. Set up Selenium WebDriver (use ChromeDriver version compatible with latest Chrome)
3. Implement functions to scrape:
   a. Top 20 products for specific search queries
   b. 'FLASH DEALS' and 'Trending Products' from main/category pages
4. Use explicit waits and proper error handling to manage dynamic content loading
5. Implement anti-bot detection measures (e.g., random delays, user-agent rotation)
6. Format scraped data into a structured format
7. Implement data cleaning and transformation to match Supabase schema

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for each scraping function. Test with various search queries and page layouts. Verify that the scraper can handle different Shopee page structures and error scenarios.
