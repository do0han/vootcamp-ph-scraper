# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Concurrent Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for concurrent report generation to handle multiple requests.
# Details:
1. Use asyncio for concurrent processing
2. Implement a queue system for incoming requests
3. Limit concurrent executions to 5
4. Add proper error handling and logging for concurrent operations

Example:
```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Queue

class AIReportGenerator:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    async def process_queue(self):
        queue = Queue()
        workers = [asyncio.create_task(self.worker(queue)) for _ in range(5)]
        await queue.join()
        for w in workers:
            w.cancel()
    
    async def worker(self, queue):
        while True:
            user_id = await queue.get()
            try:
                await self.generate_and_store_report(user_id)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f'Failed to process user {user_id}: {str(e)}')
            finally:
                queue.task_done()
    
    async def generate_and_store_report(self, user_id):
        report_content = await self.generate_report(user_id)
        await self.store_report(user_id, report_content)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for concurrent processing methods
2. Test with mock long-running tasks
3. Verify correct handling of multiple concurrent requests
4. Stress test with high concurrency to ensure limit is respected
5. Verify error handling in concurrent scenario
