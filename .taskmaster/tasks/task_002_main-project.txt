# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Google Trends Data Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a module to collect data from Google Trends using the pytrends library.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'google_trends_scraper.py'
2. Use pytrends library (version 4.9.0 or later) to connect to Google Trends
3. Implement functions to collect:
   a. 'Trending Now' topics for the Philippines in the last 24 hours
   b. 'Related queries' (Rising) for specific categories
4. Handle rate limiting and errors
5. Format the collected data into a structured format (e.g., list of dictionaries)
6. Implement data transformation to match the required schema for Supabase storage

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each function. Test with mock data and real API calls. Verify that the collected data matches the expected format and contains all required fields.
