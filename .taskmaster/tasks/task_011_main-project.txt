# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Data Validation and Cleaning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop data validation and cleaning mechanisms to ensure data quality before storage.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'data_processor.py'
2. Implement functions for each data type (Google Trends, Shopee, TikTok) to:
   a. Validate data structure and types
   b. Clean and normalize text data (remove extra spaces, normalize unicode characters)
   c. Convert data types as necessary (e.g., string to datetime)
   d. Handle missing or invalid data
3. Implement data deduplication logic
4. Use the 'pandas' library (version 1.5.0 or later) for efficient data manipulation
5. Integrate data processing into the main workflow before Supabase insertion

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for each data processing function. Test with various input data including edge cases and malformed data. Verify that the output data meets the expected format and quality standards.
