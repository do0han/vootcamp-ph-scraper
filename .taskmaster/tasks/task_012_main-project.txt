# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Scraping Job Scheduler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a scheduling system to automate periodic scraping tasks.
# Details:
1. Research and select a task scheduling library (e.g., APScheduler 3.10.1)
2. Create a new file 'scheduler.py'
3. Implement functions to:
   a. Schedule daily runs for Google Trends and Shopee scraping
   b. Schedule weekly runs for TikTok scraping
   c. Allow for manual override and immediate execution
4. Integrate scheduler with the main scraper orchestrator
5. Implement proper error handling and logging for scheduled jobs
6. Ensure the scheduler can handle timezone differences (use Philippines time)

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for scheduling logic. Verify that jobs are scheduled correctly and execute at the specified times. Test error handling and manual override functionality.
