# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Proxy Rotation Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to rotate IP addresses using proxies to avoid IP bans and improve scraping reliability.
# Details:
1. Research and select a reliable proxy service (e.g., Bright Data, Oxylabs)
2. Create a new file 'proxy_manager.py'
3. Implement functions to:
   a. Fetch a list of proxies from the chosen service
   b. Rotate proxies based on usage or time intervals
   c. Handle proxy errors and blacklisting
4. Integrate proxy rotation with Selenium and requests library usage in scrapers
5. Implement proper error handling and logging for proxy-related issues

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for proxy rotation logic. Test integration with scrapers. Verify that the system can handle proxy errors and continue scraping with alternative IPs.
