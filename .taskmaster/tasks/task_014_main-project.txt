# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Basic Analytics Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a module to perform basic analytics on the collected data.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'analytics.py'
2. Use pandas and numpy libraries for data analysis
3. Implement functions to:
   a. Calculate daily/weekly trend changes in Google Trends data
   b. Identify top-performing products and categories in Shopee data
   c. Analyze hashtag popularity and growth rates in TikTok data
4. Generate basic statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation) for relevant metrics
5. Implement data visualization using matplotlib or seaborn libraries
6. Store analytics results in a separate Supabase table

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for each analytics function. Verify calculations with known datasets. Test visualization outputs. Ensure that analytics results are correctly stored in Supabase.
