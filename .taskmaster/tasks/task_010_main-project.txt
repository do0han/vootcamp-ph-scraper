# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Logging and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up a comprehensive logging system and implement basic monitoring for the scraper operations.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'logger.py'
2. Use Python's built-in logging module to set up a custom logger
3. Implement different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
4. Set up log rotation to manage log file sizes
5. Integrate logging throughout all modules
6. Implement a basic monitoring system to track:
   a. Scraping success rates
   b. Data collection volumes
   c. Error frequencies
7. Set up email notifications for critical errors using the 'smtplib' module

# Test Strategy:
Verify that logs are being generated correctly for different scenarios. Test log rotation. Simulate various error conditions and verify that appropriate notifications are sent.
