# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Data Backup and Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system for regular backups of scraped data and implement recovery mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'backup_manager.py'
2. Implement functions to:
   a. Perform regular backups of Supabase data
   b. Store backups securely (consider using cloud storage like AWS S3)
   c. Implement backup rotation and retention policies
3. Develop recovery mechanisms to restore data from backups
4. Implement integrity checks for backups
5. Set up scheduling for regular backups
6. Implement logging and notifications for backup and recovery operations

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for backup and recovery functions. Verify data integrity after backup and restore operations. Test various failure scenarios and ensure proper recovery. Validate that backup retention policies are correctly applied.
