# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Scraper Configuration Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a system to manage and update scraper configurations dynamically.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'config_manager.py'
2. Implement a configuration storage system using JSON or YAML
3. Develop functions to:
   a. Load configurations from file or database
   b. Update configurations dynamically
   c. Validate configuration changes
4. Store sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys) securely using environment variables
5. Implement a mechanism to reload configurations without restarting the scraper
6. Update all modules to use the centralized configuration management system

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for configuration loading and updating. Verify that sensitive data is handled securely. Test dynamic configuration updates and validate that changes are reflected in scraper behavior.
