# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting and Backoff Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to manage request rates and implement exponential backoff for failed requests.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'rate_limiter.py'
2. Implement a rate limiting decorator using the 'ratelimit' library (version 2.2.1 or later)
3. Develop an exponential backoff mechanism for failed requests
4. Integrate rate limiting and backoff strategy with all scraper modules
5. Implement configurable rates for different platforms (Google Trends, Shopee, TikTok)
6. Add logging for rate limit hits and backoff events

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for rate limiting and backoff logic. Simulate various scenarios including rapid requests and server errors. Verify that the system respects rate limits and properly implements backoff strategy.
