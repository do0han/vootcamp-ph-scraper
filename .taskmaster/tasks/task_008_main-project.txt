# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement User-Agent Rotation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a mechanism to rotate user-agent strings to further avoid detection.
# Details:
1. Create a new file 'user_agent_manager.py'
2. Compile a list of common user-agent strings for desktop and mobile browsers
3. Implement functions to:
   a. Randomly select a user-agent string
   b. Rotate user-agents based on usage or time intervals
4. Integrate user-agent rotation with Selenium and requests library usage in scrapers
5. Ensure user-agent consistency within a single scraping session

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for user-agent selection and rotation. Verify integration with scrapers and confirm that different user-agents are being used across scraping sessions.
