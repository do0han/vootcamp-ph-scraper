# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository, set up virtual environment, and install necessary dependencies.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository named 'vootcamp-ph-scraper'
2. Initialize a Python virtual environment using venv
3. Install required packages: pytrends, selenium, beautifulsoup4, requests, supabase-py
4. Create a requirements.txt file
5. Set up a .gitignore file to exclude virtual environment and sensitive information
6. Create a basic project structure with folders for each data source (google_trends, shopee, tiktok) and a main.py file

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository is created, virtual environment is working, and all dependencies are installed correctly. Run a simple test script to ensure all imported libraries work without errors.
